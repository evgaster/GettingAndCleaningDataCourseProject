GettingAndcleaningdatacourseproject
===================================

A repository for the project of the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

# Obtaining the input for the project.
Via www.coursera.org --> Getting and Cleaning Data --> Course Project, I got to the projects web page.

There I found a [link to the data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and a [link to a description](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

I downloaded the data on 2014-10-11 22:04. After unzipping I got a (sub)directory "UCI HAR Dataset".

# Inspecting the input.
